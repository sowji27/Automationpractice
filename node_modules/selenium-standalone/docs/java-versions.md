### Ensure you have the minimum required Java version

With the release of Selenium 3+, the minimum required version of Java is 8, as [7 has ceased public updates](https://java.com/en/download/faq/java_7.xml).

If an older selenium version is needed, you can check the requirements on the [official Selenium changelog](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/SeleniumHQ/selenium/master/java/CHANGELOG).

Here is a reference sheet for the more recent Selenium version:

| Selenium version | Minimum Java Required |
|   ---   |   ---   |
| 3.0.0+  | Java 8  |
| 2.47.0+ | Java 7  |
| 2.22.0+ | Java 6  |
